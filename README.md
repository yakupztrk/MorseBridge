# MorseBridge
MorseBridge is a desktop application written in C language that allows people with speech impairments to communicate with other people using the Morse code. To do this, it distinguishes short clicks as dots and long clicks as dashes, then converts them into readable text. This code can be adjusted for many patients' situations.
